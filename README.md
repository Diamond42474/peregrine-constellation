# Peregrine Constellation
*Peregrine Constellation* is an open, decentralized mesh networking project designed to enable long-range, infrastructure-free communication between nodes. Each node acts as both a transmitter and repeater, forming a resilient peer-to-peer network that can operate without internet or cell service. The goal is to create a lightweight, open-source framework that allows anyone to build compatible hardware and join the network.
